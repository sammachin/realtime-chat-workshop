To help you see this in action more quickly, Iâ€™ve provided a <a href="https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:729047367331:applications~simple-websockets-chat-app">simple-websocket-chat-app</a> in the AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR) that you can easily deploy (that includes the Lambda functions, DynamoDB table definition, and IAM roles). In addition, the same app is available in AWS SAM application in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/simple-websockets-chat-app">GitHub</a>&nbsp;repo.
