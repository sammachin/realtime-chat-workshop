# Building a real-time app with WebSockets in Amazon API Gateway

<p style='text-align: left;'>
    Historically, building WebSocket APIs required setting up fleets of hosts that were responsible for managing the persistent connections that underlie the WebSocket protocol. Now, with API Gateway, this is no longer necessary. API Gateway handles the connections between the client and service. It lets you build your business logic using HTTP-based backends such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, or any other HTTP endpoint.
