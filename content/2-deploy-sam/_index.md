To help you deploy more quickly, we have provided a <a href="https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:729047367331:applications~simple-websockets-chat-app">simple-websocket-chat-app</a> in the AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR) that you can easily deploy (that includes the Lambda functions, DynamoDB table definition, and IAM roles). 

Visit the application above and press the **deploy** button. 

This should then go to your AWS account (you will need to login) and take you to a page where you can deploy the application. 

You will need to tick the box that says "I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM roles and resource policies." and the press the **Deploy** button at the bottom of the screen.
