## Set up a code editor/IDE

A code editor is a program designed specifically for editing computer code. There are many great ones out there. Visual Studio 2017 or VS Code are great choices.

If you haven't worked with a code editor before, we recommend [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you choose to use VS Code, visit the [VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and download the version appropriate for your platform.
