Clone our base application, we will need this to start building our app. Its a very basic starter website but we have added Vue.js and a few other dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/thebeebs/realtime-workshop.git
```

Once you have cloned the site move into the directory

```
cd realtime-workshop
```
